Company K Network and Wi-Fi Issues
1. Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for troubleshooting common network and Wi-Fi issues at Company K. The guide is designed to help employees resolve basic connectivity problems before escalating them to the IT department.
2. Scope
This guide applies to all Company K employees experiencing issues with their wired or wireless network connection, whether they are working on-site or remotely. The instructions cover problems with connectivity, slow speeds, and intermittent Wi-Fi disconnections.
General Troubleshooting for Network and Wi-Fi Issues
Before moving to specific cases, ensure you perform these general checks:
Restart the Device:
Reboot the computer, laptop, or mobile device. Many temporary connection issues can be resolved with a simple restart.
Check for Network Outages:
If multiple employees are facing network problems, it might be a broader network outage. Contact IT to verify if there is a system-wide issue.
Check Wi-Fi Password:
Ensure that you are entering the correct password for the Wi-Fi network. Verify with IT if there has been a recent change to the network credentials.
Verify Router and Modem Status (If Remote):
Make sure the modem and router are powered on and functioning correctly. Restarting them can often resolve connectivity issues.

Common Network and Wi-Fi Issues
1. Can’t Connect to Wi-Fi
Step 1: Verify Network Selection
Check if you are attempting to connect to the correct Wi-Fi network. Select the company network (e.g., "Company K Wi-Fi") and re-enter the password if necessary.
Step 2: Check Airplane Mode
Ensure that your device is not in airplane mode, which disables wireless communication. Turn off airplane mode if it's enabled.
Step 3: Forget Wi-Fi Network and Reconnect
On Windows: Go to "Settings" → "Network & Internet" → "Wi-Fi" → "Manage Known Networks" and forget the Wi-Fi network. Then, reconnect.
On macOS: Go to "System Preferences" → "Network" → "Wi-Fi" → "Advanced," then select the network and click the minus (-) button to forget it. Reconnect to the network.
Step 4: Restart Router and Modem
If you're working remotely, power cycle your router and modem by unplugging them for 30 seconds, then plugging them back in. Wait a few minutes for the network to come back online.
Step 5: Network Adapter Reset (Windows)
On Windows, go to "Device Manager," find "Network Adapters," and right-click the Wi-Fi adapter. Select "Disable," wait a few seconds, then enable it again.
Step 6: IT Assistance
If the issue persists, contact the IT department for assistance, as it may be a network configuration issue or a hardware problem.

2. Slow Internet Connection
Step 1: Test Internet Speed
Use a service like speedtest.net to check your internet speed. If the speed is significantly lower than expected, proceed with troubleshooting.
Step 2: Check for Bandwidth-Hogging Applications
Close applications or browser tabs that may be using large amounts of bandwidth, such as streaming services, cloud backups, or large file downloads.
Step 3: Move Closer to the Router
For Wi-Fi connections, the distance from the router can impact signal strength. Try moving closer to the router to see if it improves the connection.
Step 4: Switch Wi-Fi Frequency
Many routers broadcast on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. The 5 GHz frequency often provides faster speeds but has a shorter range. Try switching to the other band:
On Windows/macOS, select the 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz version of your Wi-Fi network (if available).
Step 5: Check for Interference
Other wireless devices (e.g., cordless phones, microwaves) may cause interference. Try to reduce interference by keeping these devices away from the router or switching Wi-Fi channels.
Step 6: Restart Router
Restart the router to clear any temporary congestion or network issues. If remote, ask your local network administrator to restart the router.

3. Intermittent Wi-Fi Disconnections
Step 1: Check Signal Strength
Weak Wi-Fi signals often result in intermittent disconnections. Ensure your device is within range of the router and free from physical obstructions (e.g., walls, furniture).
Step 2: Update Network Drivers
On Windows: Go to "Device Manager," locate your network adapter, right-click, and select "Update Driver."
On macOS: Ensure you are running the latest macOS update. Go to "System Preferences" → "Software Update."
Step 3: Reset Network Settings
Windows: Go to "Settings" → "Network & Internet" → "Status" → "Network reset." This will reset all network adapters and reinstall them.
macOS: Open "System Preferences" → "Network," click Wi-Fi, then the minus (-) button, and re-add it.
Step 4: Router Channel Interference
In densely populated areas or offices with multiple Wi-Fi networks, routers on the same channel can cause interference. IT can change the Wi-Fi channel via the router settings to reduce this interference.
Step 5: Restart Devices
Restart both the computer and the router. If using a mobile device, restart that as well.

4. No Internet Connection (Wired Network)
Step 1: Check Ethernet Cable Connection
Ensure that the Ethernet cable is securely plugged into both the computer and the network port.
Step 2: Try a Different Port
Plug the Ethernet cable into a different port on the router or switch to ensure the original port isn’t faulty.
Step 3: Test with Another Device
If available, try using a different device to connect to the same Ethernet port and determine if the issue is specific to your computer.
Step 4: Network Adapter Reset
Windows: Go to "Device Manager," right-click the Ethernet adapter, and select "Disable." Wait for 10 seconds, then enable it again.
macOS: Go to "System Preferences" → "Network" and re-enable the Ethernet connection.
Step 5: IT Assistance
If the connection is still not working, report the issue to IT for further investigation. It may be related to the network switch, firewall, or other equipment.

5. Can’t Access Specific Websites or Services
Step 1: Test with Other Websites
If a specific website or service isn’t loading, check if other websites are working. This will determine if the problem is with the website or your connection.
Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
Clear the browser’s cache and cookies. In most browsers, you can do this by going to "Settings" → "Privacy and Security" → "Clear Browsing Data."
Step 3: Check Firewall or VPN
If you are using a firewall or VPN, it may be blocking access to certain sites. Temporarily disable these services to see if that resolves the issue.
Step 4: Check Network Restrictions
Company K may have network restrictions that block access to certain websites. Verify with IT if the website is restricted or blacklisted.
