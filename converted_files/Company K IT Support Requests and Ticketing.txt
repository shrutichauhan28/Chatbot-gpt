4. IT Ticketing System
Once a support request is submitted, it will be logged into Company K’s ticketing system. The ticketing system enables IT staff to manage, prioritize, and track support requests to resolution.
4.1 Ticket Creation
When a support request is submitted via the Helpdesk Portal or email, a ticket is automatically generated and assigned a unique ticket number.
Employees will receive an email confirmation with the ticket number, issue summary, and estimated response time.
4.2 Ticket Categories
Tickets are categorized based on the type of issue:
Software Issues: Problems with installed software or applications.
Hardware Issues: Troubleshooting for company-issued devices (e.g., laptops, printers).
Network Issues: Connectivity problems, VPN access, or internal network issues.
System Access: Requests for access to internal tools or resetting passwords.
Other: Miscellaneous IT-related issues not covered by the above categories.

5. Prioritization of Tickets
The IT department will prioritize tickets based on urgency, severity, and business impact. Each ticket is assigned one of the following priority levels:
5.1 Priority Levels
Critical: Severe business impact or system outage affecting multiple users (e.g., company-wide email failure, network outage).
Response Time: Immediate response (within 1 hour).
High: High-impact issues affecting an individual’s ability to work (e.g., hardware failure, no access to essential tools).
Response Time: Within 4 hours.
Medium: Moderate issues that can be worked around (e.g., slow system performance, minor application bugs).
Response Time: Within 1 business day.
Low: Minor issues, general inquiries, or non-urgent requests (e.g., software upgrade requests, non-critical troubleshooting).
Response Time: Within 2-3 business days.
5.2 Escalation Process
If an issue cannot be resolved within the estimated response time, the ticket will be escalated to a senior technician or specialized team.
Escalations will also occur for issues that have a significant impact on critical business operations.

6. Ticket Resolution Process
Once a ticket is assigned, IT staff will work to resolve the issue based on the priority level.
6.1 Resolution Steps
Ticket Assignment: The ticket is assigned to an appropriate technician based on the issue category.
Investigation: The technician will investigate the issue, gather necessary data, and attempt troubleshooting steps.
Communication: The employee who submitted the ticket will receive regular updates on the status of their issue.
Resolution: Once the issue is resolved, the technician will close the ticket and send a resolution summary.
6.2 Ticket Closure
Employees will receive an email notification when the ticket is closed, confirming the resolution.
If the issue persists after closure, employees may reopen the ticket by replying to the email or submitting a new ticket referencing the original issue.

7. Common IT Support Issues
Below are examples of common IT support requests and the typical resolution processes:
7.1 Software Installation
Request: Employee requests installation of a new software tool (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack).
Resolution: IT verifies the licensing and installs the software remotely or provides the user with installation instructions.
7.2 Hardware Malfunction
Request: Employee reports that their laptop is not booting up.
Resolution: IT provides troubleshooting steps (e.g., battery check, restart). If unresolved, the employee may be required to bring the device to the IT support desk for repair or replacement.

Resolution: IT verifies the network settings, reconfigures VPN software, and provides instructions for reconnecting.

Provide Detailed Information: Include as much detail as possible in the support request (e.g., screenshots, error messages, affected systems).
Categorize Issues Correctly: Select the appropriate category when submitting a ticket to ensure the issue is assigned to the correct team.
Follow Up Promptly: If IT requests additional information or actions (e.g., rebooting a device, providing logs), respond promptly to avoid delays in resolving the issue.

9. IT Support for Remote Employees
Company K provides IT support for remote employees, ensuring that they can access company systems and resolve technical issues from off-site locations.
