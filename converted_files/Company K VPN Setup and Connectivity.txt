Company K VPN Setup and Connectivity
1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedures for setting up and connecting to the Company K Virtual Private Network (VPN). The VPN allows employees to securely access Company K’s internal network and resources remotely. This policy ensures that all connections are secure, compliant with IT standards, and minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who require remote access to Company K’s internal systems and resources. It covers the requirements for VPN usage, setup instructions, connectivity troubleshooting, and security guidelines.
VPN Usage Guidelines
3. Authorized Use
Employee Access: Only authorized employees, contractors, and partners may use the VPN to access Company K’s network. Approval must be obtained from the IT department.
Access Rights: VPN access will be granted based on the employee’s role and business requirements. Sensitive systems and databases may require additional security measures.
Data Encryption: All data transmitted over the VPN will be encrypted to protect sensitive information from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.
4. VPN Security
Strong Authentication: All VPN users must use a unique username and strong password, following Company K’s password management policy.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Two-factor authentication is required for VPN access to provide an additional layer of security. Employees will need both their password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device or email.
Device Security: Only company-approved and secure devices may connect to the VPN. Personal devices must meet security standards set by IT, including up-to-date antivirus software and a secure firewall.
Connection Timeouts: Inactive VPN sessions will be automatically disconnected after a specified period to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

VPN Security Best Practices
10. Secure Use of VPN
Public Wi-Fi: Employees are advised to avoid using public Wi-Fi networks when accessing the VPN, as these networks may be insecure. If public Wi-Fi must be used, employees should ensure their device firewall is enabled and that they log out immediately after use.
