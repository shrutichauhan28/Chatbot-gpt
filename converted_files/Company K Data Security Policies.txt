Company K Data Security Policies
1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to safeguard Company K's data and ensure that all employees, contractors, and third-party collaborators understand and adhere to the necessary data protection measures. This policy outlines the standards for handling sensitive, confidential, and proprietary data to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party collaborators who handle Company K's data, including personal data, intellectual property, client information, financial records, and any other sensitive information. It covers data stored on company devices, networks, cloud systems, and external storage media.

3. Key Data Security Principles
Company K's data security policies are based on the following principles:
Confidentiality: Only authorized personnel should access sensitive information.
Integrity: Ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized modifications.
Availability: Ensure authorized users have access to data and systems when required.
Accountability: Ensure that every employee is responsible for protecting the data they handle.

4. Data Classification
Data at Company K is classified into three categories to ensure appropriate levels of security based on sensitivity:
4.1 Public Data
Data that can be freely shared with the public (e.g., marketing materials, website content).
Protection Requirements: Minimal security; no confidentiality measures required.
4.2 Internal Use Only
Data that is accessible to Company K employees but should not be shared externally (e.g., internal reports, employee directories).
Protection Requirements: Moderate security; access controls must be in place.
4.3 Confidential Data
Sensitive data that is strictly limited to specific employees, departments, or teams (e.g., client data, financial records, trade secrets).
Protection Requirements: High security; encryption, strong access controls, and additional safeguards required.

5. Data Handling Guidelines
5.1 Access Control
Least Privilege: Employees should only have access to the data necessary to perform their job functions.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Required for access to critical systems and sensitive data.
Role-Based Access: Data access will be granted based on employee roles (e.g., HR, IT, Finance), ensuring employees can only view relevant data.
Periodic Audits: Access levels will be regularly reviewed by the IT and Security teams to ensure that employees’ access remains appropriate for their current role.
5.2 Data Transmission
Encryption: All sensitive data transmitted over networks (including email, cloud services, or file transfers) must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS).
Secure Channels: Employees must use secure channels (e.g., VPN, encrypted emails) when accessing or sharing sensitive data remotely.
5.3 Data Storage
Encryption at Rest: Confidential data must be stored in encrypted form, whether on company devices, servers, or in the cloud.
Cloud Security: Data stored in cloud services (e.g., Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) must be protected by strong access controls and encryption.
Removable Media: Storing sensitive data on external or removable media (e.g., USB drives) should be avoided. If necessary, these devices must be encrypted and securely stored.

6. Device and System Security
6.1 Device Security
Passwords: All company devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, tablets) must be protected by strong, unique passwords that adhere to the Password Management and Reset policy.
Screen Lock: Devices must be configured to automatically lock after a period of inactivity (e.g., 10 minutes).
Antivirus & Malware Protection: Devices must have up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software installed.
Mobile Device Management (MDM): Company-issued mobile devices will be managed through an MDM solution, allowing IT to enforce security policies and remotely wipe data if a device is lost or stolen.
6.2 Network Security
Virtual Private Network (VPN): Employees must use Company K’s VPN when accessing the internal network remotely or from public Wi-Fi networks.
Firewalls: Company systems will be protected by firewalls to prevent unauthorized network access.
Wi-Fi Security: Employees should use secure Wi-Fi networks (e.g., WPA2 encryption) and avoid connecting to public or unsecured Wi-Fi for work purposes.

7. Data Backup and Recovery
Regular Backups: Company K will perform regular backups of critical data to prevent data loss due to hardware failures, cyber-attacks, or other incidents.
Backup Encryption: All backup data must be encrypted.
Disaster Recovery Plan: Company K has a disaster recovery plan that includes procedures for restoring data from backups in the event of a data loss incident.

8. Data Breach Response
In the event of a data breach, Company K will follow a formal incident response process to contain the breach, investigate the cause, and mitigate its impact.
8.1 Incident Reporting
Employees must report any data security incidents, including suspected breaches or unauthorized access, to the IT Security team immediately.
IT will initiate the Incident Response Plan, which includes investigation, documentation, and reporting to the relevant stakeholders.
8.2 Data Breach Notification
In the event of a significant data breach involving sensitive information, affected employees, clients, and regulatory authorities will be notified within the required time frame (e.g., 72 hours for GDPR compliance).

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): For the protection of personal data belonging to individuals within the European Union.
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): For protecting the privacy of California residents.
