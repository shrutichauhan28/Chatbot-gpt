<p>Company K Overtime Policies</p><p>Introduction: Company K values the hard work and dedication of its employees. This Overtime Policy provides clear guidelines on overtime work, ensuring that employees are fairly compensated for additional hours worked beyond their regular schedule while maintaining a balance between work and personal life.</p><p></p><p>1. Definition of Overtime</p><p>Overtime Work: Any time worked beyond the employee’s standard work hours as defined by their contract or local labor laws.</p><p>Standard Workweek: A standard workweek at Company K consists of 40 hours (8 hours per day, 5 days per week).</p><p>Eligible for Overtime: Non-exempt employees (hourly employees or salaried employees classified as non-exempt) are eligible for overtime pay.</p><p></p><p>2. Overtime Approval Process</p><p>Pre-Approval: Overtime work must be pre-approved by a manager or supervisor before it is performed.</p><p>Employees are not permitted to work overtime without explicit written or verbal consent from their immediate supervisor.</p><p>In emergencies where pre-approval is not possible, the employee must notify their manager as soon as possible.</p><p>Documentation: All overtime hours must be accurately recorded in the time-tracking system for payroll purposes.</p><p></p><p>3. Overtime Compensation</p><p>Hourly Rate Overtime: Non-exempt employees will be compensated for overtime as follows:</p><p>Regular Overtime: 1.5 times the employee’s regular hourly rate for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek.</p><p>Double Overtime: 2 times the employee’s regular hourly rate for any hours worked beyond 12 hours in a single day (where applicable by local laws).</p><p>Time Off in Lieu (TOIL): Instead of overtime pay, employees may choose to receive compensatory time off (also known as "time off in lieu").</p><p>Accrual of TOIL: For every hour of overtime worked, employees will receive 1.5 hours of compensatory time off.</p><p>Usage of TOIL: Compensatory time off must be used within three months of accrual, subject to management approval and operational requirements.</p><p></p><p>4. Exempt Employees and Overtime</p><p>Exempt Employees: Employees classified as exempt from overtime (typically managers, executives, and certain salaried professionals) are not entitled to overtime pay.</p><p>Exempt employees are expected to manage their workload within regular working hours, but may occasionally work beyond standard hours to meet deadlines or business needs.</p><p>In cases of extraordinary workload, management may offer exempt employees additional time off at their discretion, but this is not required.</p><p></p><p>5. Maximum Overtime Limits</p><p>Local Labor Law Compliance: Overtime work is subject to local labor laws, which may set maximum limits on the number of overtime hours an employee can work within a given period (daily, weekly, or monthly).</p><p>Health and Safety Considerations: Company K recognizes the importance of rest and well-being, and therefore encourages employees to avoid excessive overtime.</p><p>Employees should not exceed 12 hours of work in any 24-hour period without taking a minimum rest break of 8 hours.</p><p>Employees should not work more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, except in extraordinary circumstances.</p><p></p><p>6. Breaks During Overtime</p><p>Meal and Rest Breaks: Employees working overtime are entitled to additional breaks in accordance with local laws.</p><p>For every 4 hours of overtime worked, the employee is entitled to a 15-minute paid rest break.</p><p>Employees working more than 10 consecutive hours, including overtime, are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes.</p><p></p><p>7. Special Circumstances</p><p>7.1 Weekends and Public Holidays</p><p>Employees required to work on weekends or public holidays will be compensated at 2 times their regular hourly rate.</p><p>In lieu of additional pay, employees may choose compensatory time off for weekend or holiday work, calculated at the same 2x rate.</p><p>7.2 On-Call and Emergency Overtime</p><p>Employees who are on-call or required to work during emergency situations may be eligible for a fixed on-call allowance in addition to their regular pay.</p><p>Overtime for emergency work will be compensated in accordance with the above rates.</p><p></p><p>8. Reporting Overtime Discrepancies</p><p>Payroll Discrepancies: Employees should immediately report any discrepancies in their overtime pay to the HR department or their manager.</p><p>Discrepancies will be investigated promptly, and any owed payments will be made in the next payroll cycle.</p><p></p><p>9. Compliance with Local Laws</p><p>This policy is designed to comply with local labor laws in all regions where Company K operates. In cases where local laws differ from this policy, the more favorable terms for the employee will apply.</p><p>Jurisdictional Differences: Overtime rules and rates may vary based on location and jurisdiction, including different thresholds for what constitutes overtime. Employees will be informed of the specific rules applicable to their region during onboarding.</p><p></p><p>10. Review and Amendments</p><p>This Overtime Policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in labor laws, business needs, or employee feedback.</p><p></p>
