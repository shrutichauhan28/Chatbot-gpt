Company K Two-Factor Authentication Setup
1. Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for setting up and using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) at Company K. The goal is to enhance security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to the standard password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to company accounts and systems.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party collaborators who access Company K’s systems, applications, or networks that support Two-Factor Authentication.

3. Overview of Two-Factor Authentication
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification:
Something You Know: Your password or PIN.
Something You Have: A verification code generated by a device (e.g., smartphone) or sent via SMS.
This ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is still prevented without the second factor.

4. Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication
4.1 Prerequisites
Ensure you have a compatible device for receiving or generating 2FA codes (e.g., smartphone with an authenticator app, mobile phone for SMS).
Have your Company K credentials (username and password) ready.
4.2 Enabling 2FA for Company K Accounts
Log In to Your Account
Visit the Company K account login page and sign in with your username and password.
Access Security Settings
Navigate to the security settings or account settings section of your account profile.
Select Two-Factor Authentication
Look for the option to enable Two-Factor Authentication. This might be under a section titled “Security” or “Authentication.”
Choose Your 2FA Method
Authenticator App: Choose this method if you prefer to use an app that generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs). Popular apps include Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and Authy.
SMS/Text Message: Choose this method if you prefer to receive verification codes via SMS.
Setup Process
For Authenticator Apps:
Install an Authenticator App: Download and install an authenticator app on your smartphone.
Scan QR Code: Use the app to scan the QR code displayed on the setup page.
Enter Code: The app will generate a verification code. Enter this code on the setup page to complete the process.
For SMS/Text Messages:
Enter Phone Number: Input your mobile phone number where you wish to receive verification codes.
Receive Code: A verification code will be sent to your phone via SMS.
Enter Code: Input the code received on the setup page to complete the process.
Backup Codes
Once 2FA is set up, you may be provided with backup codes. Save these codes in a secure location. They can be used if you lose access to your primary 2FA method (e.g., if your phone is lost or damaged).
Verify Setup
Log out of your account and log back in to test that 2FA is working correctly. You should be prompted to enter a verification code in addition to your password.

5. Using Two-Factor Authentication
5.1 Logging In with 2FA
Enter your username and password on the login page.
You will be prompted to enter a verification code.
Open your authenticator app or check your SMS for the code and enter it into the provided field.
Access will be granted if the code is correct.
5.2 Recovering Your Account
If you lose access to your 2FA method:
Use Backup Codes: If you have backup codes, use one of them to access your account.
Contact IT Support: If you do not have backup codes or need additional assistance, contact the IT Support team at it-support@companyk.com for help with account recovery.

6. Best Practices for Two-Factor Authentication
Keep Your Device Secure: Ensure that the device used for receiving or generating 2FA codes is secure. Use a password or biometric lock on your device.
Update Your Contact Information: Ensure your mobile phone number is up-to-date in case you use SMS for 2FA.
Be Cautious with Backup Codes: Store backup codes in a secure place, separate from your primary 2FA device.

7. Troubleshooting
7.1 Common Issues
Authenticator App Not Generating Codes: Ensure the time on your phone is correctly synchronized. Some apps require accurate time settings to generate valid codes.
SMS Code Not Received: Check if your phone has signal or try restarting your phone. Contact IT Support if the issue persists.
