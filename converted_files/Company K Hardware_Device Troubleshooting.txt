Company K Hardware/Device Troubleshooting
1. Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive guide to troubleshooting common hardware and device-related issues that may occur while using company-approved laptops, desktops, printers, and mobile devices. The aim is to assist employees in resolving minor hardware issues independently before reaching out to IT support.
2. Scope
This guide applies to all employees at Company K who use company-issued hardware and devices for work. The troubleshooting methods outlined cover basic issues with computers (Windows/macOS), printers, monitors, and other peripherals. For more complex issues, employees should contact the IT department.
General Troubleshooting Steps
Before diving into specific hardware problems, always follow these initial troubleshooting steps for most devices:
Check Power Supply:
Ensure that the device is properly plugged into a power source.
Verify that the power cable is securely connected to the outlet and device.
Restart the Device:
Power off the device, wait for 30 seconds, and power it back on. Many minor issues can be resolved by restarting.
Check Cables and Connections:
Inspect all cables (power, data, etc.) for damage and ensure they are properly connected.
Update Software and Drivers:
Ensure that your operating system, firmware, and drivers are up to date.
Consult the User Manual:
Refer to the device’s manual for specific troubleshooting advice related to that hardware.
Troubleshooting Examples
1. Laptop/Desktop Won’t Turn On
This is a common issue where the laptop or desktop is completely unresponsive.
Windows/Mac:
Step 1: Check Power Connection
Ensure the laptop/desktop is connected to a power source.
For laptops, make sure the charging adapter is securely plugged in and that the charging indicator is lit.
Step 2: Perform a Power Cycle
Disconnect the power cable, hold down the power button for 10-15 seconds to discharge any residual power.
Reconnect the power cable and try turning on the device.
Step 3: Check for Signs of Life
Look for any signs such as lights or fan noise. If there is no response, test with a different power adapter or outlet.
Step 4: Battery Reset (Laptop)
On some laptops, hold down a specific key (e.g., F2 or F10) to perform a hardware reset if the power button alone doesn’t work.
Step 5: Contact IT
If none of these steps work, submit a support ticket to IT for further assistance.

2. Monitor Not Displaying
If the monitor is powered on but not displaying anything:
Step 1: Check Cable Connections
Ensure the monitor is connected to the computer via HDMI, DisplayPort, or VGA cable.
Verify that the monitor is set to the correct input source (e.g., HDMI 1, DisplayPort 1).
Step 2: Check Power Supply
Make sure the monitor is plugged into a power outlet and the power light is on.
Step 3: Test with Another Device
Connect the monitor to another computer or laptop to determine if the issue lies with the monitor or the computer.
Step 4: Update Graphics Drivers
For Windows, open "Device Manager," locate "Display Adapters," and update the driver.
On macOS, ensure you are running the latest macOS version.
Step 5: Restart the Computer
Sometimes restarting the computer can refresh the display settings and resolve the issue.

3. Printer Not Printing
Common printer issues include being unable to print or print jobs getting stuck in the queue.
Step 1: Check Printer Connection
Ensure the printer is properly connected to the computer via USB or to the network for wireless printers.
Verify that the printer is powered on and there are no error lights.
Step 2: Clear Print Queue
On Windows, go to "Devices and Printers," right-click the printer, and select “See what’s printing.” If there are stuck print jobs, clear the queue.
On macOS, go to “System Preferences,” then “Printers & Scanners,” and clear any stalled print jobs.
Step 3: Check for Paper Jams
Open the printer and inspect for paper jams or misaligned paper in the tray.
Step 4: Reinstall Printer Driver
Download and install the latest printer drivers from the manufacturer’s website. A corrupted driver can cause printing issues.
Step 5: Restart Printer and Computer
Restart both the printer and your computer to refresh the connection.

4. Keyboard or Mouse Not Responding
If your keyboard or mouse isn’t functioning:
Step 1: Check the Connection
For wired keyboards or mice, ensure that the USB cable is securely plugged into the computer.
For wireless devices, check the battery level or recharge the device if necessary.
Step 2: Test with Another Device
Plug the keyboard/mouse into another computer to see if the issue persists.
Step 3: Reinstall Drivers
On Windows, open "Device Manager" and locate the keyboard or mouse under the "Keyboards" or "Mice and other pointing devices" section. Uninstall the driver and restart the computer; Windows will reinstall it.
On macOS, go to “System Preferences,” then “Keyboard” or “Mouse” to adjust settings.
Step 4: Replace Batteries (Wireless Devices)
Replace the batteries if using a wireless mouse or keyboard, as low battery levels often cause issues.

5. External Drive Not Detected
If your external hard drive or USB is not detected by your computer:
Step 1: Check Connection
Ensure the external drive is properly connected to the USB port. Try plugging it into a different USB port or use another cable.
Step 2: Check Drive on Another Device
Connect the external drive to another computer to determine if the issue lies with the drive or the computer.
Step 3: Update Drivers (Windows)
Open "Device Manager" and check under “Disk Drives” for the external drive. If it appears with a yellow triangle, update the driver.
Step 4: Use Disk Utility (macOS)
On macOS, open “Disk Utility” to check if the drive is detected. If it appears but isn’t mounted, try mounting the drive manually.
Step 5: Format Drive (Last Resort)
If the drive is detected but still not accessible, you may need to reformat the drive. Be aware this will erase all data on the drive.

6. Wi-Fi Connection Issues
When your device cannot connect to Wi-Fi or experiences slow speeds:
Step 1: Check Router and Modem
Ensure that the router is powered on and connected to the modem.
Restart both the router and the modem by unplugging them for 30 seconds and plugging them back in.
Step 2: Reconnect to Wi-Fi
Disconnect from the Wi-Fi network on your device and reconnect. You may need to re-enter the password.
Step 3: Test with Other Devices
Check if other devices in the office are also experiencing Wi-Fi issues. If so, the problem may be with the network.
Step 4: Forget Network (Windows/macOS)
On Windows, go to "Network & Internet Settings" and forget the network, then reconnect.
On macOS, go to “System Preferences,” select “Network,” then “Wi-Fi,” and forget the network before reconnecting.
Step 5: Contact IT for Network Issues
If you continue to experience connectivity issues, contact the IT department to check the company network or reset access points.
